    /**
     * Copy your shopping cart code from the previous challenge.
     * This time we don't want to add "Item" objects to the shopping cart. Instead, create three new classes:
     * "Book", "DVD" and "VideoGame".
     *
     * Change your shopping cart's "addItem" method so it can accept a Book, DVD or VideoGame object.
     *
     * Now make it so that books are tax-free, DVDs have 5% tax and video games have 10% tax.
     * Make sure your shopping cart can still return the total cost of items and the correct tax amount
     * the customer would need to pay.
     *
     * Bonus points: Can you implement a "removeItem" method on your shopping cart class?
