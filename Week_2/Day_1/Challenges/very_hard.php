    Let's play paper rock scissors

    Simulate 2 people playing the best of 7 (gotta win 4)
        - show the results of each "game"

        i.e.

        Game 1:
        Mark - Paper
        Eric - Rock
        Mark Wins [Mark = 1, Eric = 0]

        Game 2:
        Mark - Rock
        Eric - Scissors
        Mark Wins [Mark = 2, Eric = 0]

        etc .....
