<h1> Journey</h1>
<h2> Don't Stop Believin</h2>
	<p>	Just a small town girl
		Livin' in a lonely world
		She took the midnight train
		Goin' anywhere
		Just a city boy
		Born and raised in South Detroit
		He took the midnight train
		Goin' anywhere
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>A</strong> singer in a smokey room
		The smell of wine and cheap perfume
		For a <em>smile</em> they can share the night
		It goes on and on and on and on
<br>
		Strangers waiting
		Up and down the boulevard
		Their <sub>shadows</sub> searching
		In the night
		Streetlight <small>people</small>
		Livin' just to find emotion
		<sup>Hidin'</sup> somewhere in the night
		</p>
